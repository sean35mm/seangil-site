            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Sean Gil </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Los Angeles, CA.</span>
            <br />I am a Full Stack Developer, US Army Veteran, and Former Startup Executive.
            Throughout my career in the finance industry and military, I oversaw a frustrating gap 
            in technology amongst the myriad of low-functioning tools. 
            I believe that my skills in development and engineering will 
            contribute to the inevitable growth and utilization of tomorrowâ€™s technology.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
          </p>
