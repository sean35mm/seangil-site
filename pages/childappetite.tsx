						<h2 className='underline'>Problem</h2>
						<p>
							Iris Kwon (founder) launched her art brand in 2019 with the intention of having a
							creative outlet with her own style - which is vastly different than her full time
							position as a Design Director, where she mainly creates user experiences for tech
							companies. She chose Shopify as her quick solution because of it’s streamlined
							experience for merchants; however, she has found out that full customization is
							difficult and costly on Shopify’s platform. There are alternatives like Etsy, but
							through the years, she realized that she doesn’t need all the bells and whistles these
							platforms offer - it’s a side gig for fun afterall. As her initial discounted
							subscription to Shopify comes to an end, so does her willingness to continue with
							Shopify.{' '}
						</p>
						<h2 className='underline'>Project Overview</h2>
						<p>
							At its core, we aimed to create a website that focused on her art and not a retail
							marketplace. As the designer, Iris wanted to utilize the website not only as a
							showcase of her work but a portfolio she could share with the world.{' '}
						</p>
						<p>
							The Shopify platform primarily focuses just on the ecommerce element of the website,
							with additional pages as secondary elements. After some tweaking utilizing Shopify’s
							template language Liquid, we managed to get the site to and workable version of what
							she wanted.

						<h2 className='underline'>Engineering Abstract</h2>
						<p>
							Engineering efforts began with identifying what technologies were needed to bring the
							artist vision to life:
						</p>
						<Image src={architecture} alt='figma' />
						<h4>Hygraph</h4>
						<p>
							Hygraph is the first native GraphQL CMS. It is a frontend and backend agnostic
							API-first solution that checked all the boxes that I needed. From developing the
							schema to content modeling, Hygraph enabled us to unify the tech stack. Bonus: its
							free and extremely user friendly - which was especially important if I was going to
							show Iris on how to use it.
						</p>
						<h4>GraphQL</h4>
						<p>
							I opted to use GraphQL to handle network requests. Yes, probably overkill for a small
							web app, BUT we know that it scales, we know that there is a ton of
							documentation/tutorials, and when the time comes to migrate to TypeScript, they
							complement each other well.{' '}
						</p>
						<h4>React / Next.js</h4>
						<p>
							For a small time business and artist brand, a library like React is not exactly
							necessary to bring the idea to life, but we wanted to use something that could scale
							with additional implementations like NFT’s. React with the Next.js layer was the
							natural choice. Its seamless integration with Hygraph aphQL allows the app to hydrate
							and update itself without much developer intervention (which is important because I am
							the only developer ha!). I wanted to make this as developer friendly as possible while
							keeping the focus on the user experience.{' '}
						</p>
						<h4>Cloudinary</h4>
						<p>
							Cloudinary manages images and video in the cloud. When I first started developing,
							there were some performance issues, primarily because the art files provided were too
							complex and large in size. Cloudinary allowed us to edit and transform the images on
							demand - also free (for now)!
